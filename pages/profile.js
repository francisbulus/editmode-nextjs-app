            <p>
              Long before I became a <span>fullstack developer</span>, I was a
              kid first, a lover of math next, and then a tinkerer. I spent the
              first 15 years of my life fiddling with parts from my
              parents&apos; stereo systems and Pentium 4 PC. I went on to give
              up my makeshift screwdrivers for Sequencing Electrophoresis
              Systems at the university as a Biochemist and Geneticist.
            </p>
            <p>
              After that, I worked as a managing editor at a tech publication
              and then a social impact operations lead at a startup. Realizing
              at some point that I had unfinished business with breaking things
              apart and putting them back together (but I had clumsy hands now),
              I decided to become a Software Engineer.
            </p>
            <p>
              I applied and got into Lambda School in August, 2019. I now spend
              my days eating too-saucy chicken wings while building highy
              scalable tools for the web with{" "}
              <span>
                Javascript (Vanilla, Node, React), Python, GraphQL, SQL,
                Postgres, MongoDB, Firebase, Go, HTML, CSS, and AWS.
              </span>
            </p>
            <p>
              And when I&apos;m not building things,{" "}
